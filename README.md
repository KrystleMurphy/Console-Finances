- The total number of months included in the dataset.

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

  - You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
  - (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`)
